Chris Bodels' Image Processing Assignment

In my assignent there are 4 images able to be used however the two stars images are extremely large and I would not reccomend
attempting to use random colour or bounding box options with them as it will take an extremely long time due to the fact that
the code for those uses 3 for loops within eachother so it is not the most efficient. 
All methods work well on bacteria.bmp and shapes.bmp.

As an extra feature I have included a simple text interface for the user with rigorous validation to ensure that the program
will not unexpectedly terminate if there is any kind of bad input. I have also included a check method that is used to make sure
that ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsExceptions do not occur in the root method.

I did not leave myself enough time to get around to the test classes unfortunately but hope to include them in my next assignment.
